Welcome to the XP Games Repository. This is a collection of old games that came factory installed on Windows XP systems.
Here's a list of games that the library contains so far:

 - 3D Pinball Space Cadet
 - Minesweeper
 - Solitaire
 - Spider Solitaire
 
More games are being added soon.
# How to install and play
Simply download the desired game and be sure to extract the ZIP file, as some games require all the files in the directory to work properly.
*All games were copied from a fresh installation of Windows XP.*
